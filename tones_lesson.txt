Hi. A Tone is a frequency.
The specific tone names refer to specific or lets say defined frequencies.
The note c for example indicates a frequency of 131 Hz.
Or as a more practical example the thick string on a usual guitar is called the E-string*
because if you play it without shortening it it swings and creates a sound with the 
frequency of the e which is 165 Hz.
