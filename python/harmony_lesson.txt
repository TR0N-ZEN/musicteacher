Harmony is chosing a a root and a scaletype and only using those tones you get out of the combination of root scale.
For example:
	chosing d minor means you are allowed to use the tones: d e f g a b-flat c d

for your playing or composing you are also only allowed to use those notes for your backing with chords,
this is called harmonisation of chords.

Each level of a scale gets a certain type of chord.

for minor:
	base tone					chordtype	
	- tonic						- minor
	- subdominants-parallel		- diminished
	- dominants-parallel		- major
	- subdominant				- minor
	- dominant					- minor
	- tonics-parallele			- major
	- leading tone				- major

for major:
	base tone					chordtype	
	- tonic						- major
	- subdominants-parallel		- minor
	- dominants-parallel		- minor
	- subdominant				- major
	- dominant					- major
	- tonics-parallele			- minor
	- leading tone				- diminished

This concept however will be broken in further discussion as it offers more variety which though has to sound good, 
meaning there are rules for breaking the rules.
