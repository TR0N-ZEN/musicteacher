Harmony is chosing a a root and a scaletype and only using those tones you get out of the combination of root scale.
For example:
	chosing d minor means you are allowed to use the tones: d e f g a b-flat c d

for your playing or composing you are also only allowed to use those notes for your backing with chords,
this is called harmonisation of chords.

This concept however will be broken in further discussion as it offers more variety which though has to sound good, 
which means there are rules for breaking the rules.
