Scales are a defined row of tones being associtated to each other through the specific scales.

Every scale has got a root/ground color/keynote which is the tone the rest of the scale builds on.

From the root youÂ´ve got different ways.
You can choose whether to walk the path of the heptatonic or the pentatonic or even others.
This decision alters the kind of association.
